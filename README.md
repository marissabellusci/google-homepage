Practicing deconstructing and rebuilding a webpage
This is my README! I just learned that when you set up a new repository on Github.com and select create README, and also add a description, it auto-creates a README for you containing your description. I can also do this from the command line.

I think I will go back to this file at the end of the project and make a real README summary.
