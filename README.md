Practicing deconstructing and rebuilding a webpage
This is my fake Google homepage that I created as part of my coursework for The Odin Project. It is not meant to function like a real search engine (as of right now) but was merely an exercise in writing the HTML and CSS necessary to mimic the appearance of an existing page. This (mini-)project is one of my first projects as a newbie coder.
